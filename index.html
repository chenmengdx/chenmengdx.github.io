<p>Hi, I'm Meng Chen, and my Chinese name is <b>陈蒙</b>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
I'm currently a Technical Director at <a href="http://air.jd.com">JD AI</a> and working with <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/xiaohe/">Dr. Xiaodong He</a>. I lead a team focusing on Conversational AI, build dialogue systems in industry and explore innovative AI for Art projects. Specifically, we developed the <a href="https://xiaozhi.jd.com/">Alphasales system</a> and <a href="https://yanxi.jd.com/">Yanxi platform</a>. Alphasales is a shopping assistant which can not only answer questions about product, promotion, and shipping policy but also recommend products to customers proactively. Yanxi platform is to help ordinary users to build their own conversational bots within several minutes, which supports both text and speech interaction. For AI and Art, we collaborate with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiu_Zhijie"> Prof. Zhijie Qiu </a> from <a href="https://www.cafa.edu.cn/en/">Central Academy of Fine Arts</a>. In the past few years, we developed the Artistic Mind Map Generator and Emotion-driven Calligraphy Generator, which had been exhibited in several famous international art festivals including Asia Digital Art Exhibition 2020, Art Electronica Festival 2019, World Internet Conference 2019, Mind the Deep - AI and Art Creation 2019 etc.

Before that, I was a Research Scientist at Dragon Research of <a href="http://www.nuance.com">Nuance Communications</a>. My research interests mainly focus on computational linguistics and automatic speech recognition. I graduated from the Multimodal Intelligence Joint Lab of <a href="http://www.ucas.ac.cn/">University of Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> and <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk">The Chinese University of Hong Kong</a> in 2012. My supervisor was <a href="http://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/hmmeng.html">Prof. Helen Meng</a>. Besides, I'm currently serving as the Programme Committee member for several top academic conferences including AAAI 2021/2022/2023, ACL 2021/2022, EMNLP 2020/2021/2022, NAACL 2022, Interspeech 2022 etc.
