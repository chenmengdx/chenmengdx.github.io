<p>Hi, I'm Meng Chen, and my Chinese name is <b>陈蒙</b>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
I'm currently an algorithm leader at <a href="https://www.jd.com">JD AI</a> and dedicated to developping the applied algorithms of artificial intelligence. I lead a team focusing on Conversational AI and we aim to building various industrial dialogue systems for the government and enterprises. Specifically, we construct the chatbot with emotion intelligence for JD smart customer service, which can fix the daily problems in E-commerce after-sales scenarios for more than 500 million users. We also develop the <a href="https://xiaozhi.jd.com/">Alphasales system</a> and <a href="https://yanxi.jd.com/">Yanxi Platform</a>. Alphasales is a shopping assistant which can not only answer questions about product, promotion, and shipping policy but also recommend products to customers proactively. Yanxi platform is to help ordinary users to build their own conversational bots within several minutes, which supports both text and speech interaction. Besides, we also explore some interesting AI for Art projects via collaborating with the distinguished artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiu_Zhijie">Prof. Zhijie Qiu</a> from <a href="https://www.cafa.edu.cn/en/">Central Academy of Fine Arts</a>. In the past few years, we developed the Artistic Mind Map Generator and <a href="https://arts-academy.jd.com/">Emotion-driven Calligraphy Generator</a>, which had been exhibited in several famous international art festivals including Asia Digital Art Exhibition 2020, Art Electronica Festival 2019, World Internet Conference 2019, Mind the Deep - AI and Art Creation 2019 etc.

Before that, I was a Research Scientist at Dragon Research of <a href="http://www.nuance.com">Nuance Communications</a> (now it's a subsidiary corporation of Microsoft). My research interests mainly cover computational linguistics and automatic speech recognition. I graduated from the Multimodal Intelligence Joint Lab of <a href="http://www.ucas.ac.cn/">University of Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> and <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk">The Chinese University of Hong Kong</a> in 2012. My supervisor was <a href="http://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/hmmeng.html">Prof. Helen Meng</a>.

I'm currently serving as the Program Committee member for several top academic conferences including AAAI 2021/2022/2023, ACL 2021/2022/2023, EMNLP 2020/2021/2022/2023, NAACL 2022, EACL 2023, ICASSP 2023, Interspeech 2022/2023, ACM Multimedia 2023 etc. In my spare time, I love traveling, reading, watching movies and playing soccer.
