I'm currently a Technical Director at <a href="http://air.jd.com">JD AI</a> and working with <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/xiaohe/">Dr. Xiaodong He</a>.

Specifically, we developed the <a href="https://xiaozhi.jd.com/">Alphasales system</a> and <a href="https://yanxi.jd.com/">Yanxi platform</a>. Alphasales is a shopping assistant which can not only answer questions about product, promotion, and shipping but also recommend products to customers proactively.

For AI and Art, we collaborate with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiu_Zhijie"> Prof. Zhijie Qiu </a> from <a href="https://www.cafa.edu.cn/en/">Central Academy of Fine Arts</a>.
